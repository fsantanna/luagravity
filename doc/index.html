The `call(r)` primitive schedules the reactor passed as parameter and awaits

The callee reactor continues its execution only after the called reactor and 
all reactions to it terminate.
The following code shows this behavior with the last `assert` statement:

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>LuaGravity is a reactive language that implements the synchronous approach for 
concurrency.
It is roughly based on Esterel and FrTime, two synchronous reactive languages, 
the former having an imperative style, the latter being functional.</p>

<p>For an introductory video about LuaGravity, click 
<a href="http://thesynchronousblog.wordpress.com/lua-workshop09-video/">here</a>.</p>

<p>LuaGravity is implemented as a set of runtime extensions to the Lua language.
It provides a pure Lua <a href="#section_api">API library</a> with the reactive kernel, 
and also an extra module with the <a href="#section_meta">meta language</a> that is less 
verbose to use, and is built entirely with the kernel API.</p>

<p>The key concept of LuaGravity is its execution unit, known as <em>reactor</em>.
Reactors are comparable to callbacks of <em>event-driven programming</em>, holding the 
following similarities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reactors run implicitly, always as a consequence of a change in the 
environment.</li>
<li>The execution of reactors is atomic and conceptually instantaneous.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, reactors differ from callbacks in the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reactors are themselves events, and can be linked to each other so that a 
reactor termination triggers its dependent reactors.
This eliminates the need to explicitly declare and post events.
Conventional events, represented as strings, can still be used when 
appropriate.</li>
<li>Reactors are allowed to suspend in the middle of their execution (keeping 
local state) to wait for other reactors to terminate.
This feature permits sequential execution for reactors, while keeping their 
reactive nature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides standard Lua statements, a reactor can perform the following 
operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create new reactors.</li>
<li>Spawn and kill other reactors.</li>
<li>Activate and deactivate other reactors.</li>
<li>Create and destroy links between reactors.</li>
<li>Await on conditions.</li>
<li>Generate string events.</li>
</ul>

<p><font size="-1">
<em>(For experienced programmers: Reactors are abstractions built on top of Lua 
coroutines that count with a specialized scheduler responsible for managing the 
dependencies between them.)</em>
</font></p>

<p><a name="section_reactivity"/></p>

<h1>Reactivity Mechanisms</h1>

<p>The <code>link</code> and <code>await</code> primitives are the supported reactivity mechanisms of 
LuaGravity.</p>

<p>Follows an introductory example illustrating their use:</p>

<p><img src="ex1.png" width="250" vspace="50" hspace="50" align="right"/></p>

<pre><code>rA = luagravity.create(
    function ()
        print 'a1'     -- sub-node (1)
        luagravity.await(rB)
        print 'a2'     -- sub-node (2)
    end)

rB = luagravity.create(
    function ()
        print 'b'
    end)

luagravity.link('eA', rA)
</code></pre>

<p>We define two reactors <code>rA</code> and <code>rB</code>, linking the string event <code>'eA'</code> to <code>rA</code>.
This way, <code>rA</code> executes and prints <code>'a1'</code> whenever <code>'eA'</code> is triggered, due to 
the link between them.
Then, <code>rA</code> awaits the execution of <code>rB</code>.
When <code>rB</code> is executed somewhere, it prints <code>'b'</code> and awakes <code>rA</code>, which now 
prints <code>'a2'</code>.</p>

<p>The call to <code>await</code> saves the continuation of the running reactor before 
suspending it, keeping the locals and point of suspension to be restored on 
resume.
The graph is commented <a href="#section_scheduler">further</a>.
<font size="-1">
<em>(For experienced programmers: The <code>await</code> call yields control from the running 
reactor back to the scheduler, telling what should resume itself later.)</em>
</font></p>

<p>As the example shows, string events or reactors can be used as conditions in 
links and await calls.</p>

<p>The primitive <code>post</code> is used to generate string events:</p>

<pre><code>luagravity.link('key.A', function(key) print(key..' '..pressed))
luagravity.post('key.A')
-- yields "key.A pressed"
</code></pre>

<p>Reactors executes implicitly, as consequence of links; or explicitly, as shown 
<a href="#section_spawn">further</a>.</p>

<p><a name="section_scheduler"/></p>

<h2>The Reactive Scheduler</h2>

<p>In LuaGravity, a program is a dynamic dependency graph of reactors waiting for 
external changes to react.
In the graph, nodes are reactors with dependency relations represented by 
directed edges connecting them.</p>

<p>The scheduling policy of reactors is determined only by the dependency graph, 
leading to what we call a reactive scheduler.</p>

<p>Starting from an external stimulus, the scheduler traverses the graph running 
all dependent reactors until it reaches "leaf" reactors.
We call this process a full propagation chain, which takes an infinitesimal 
time to complete.
A full propagation chain is also our definition for an instant within the 
notion of discrete time of synchronous languages.</p>

<p>The two reactivity primitives are responsible for populating the dependency 
graph with respective kinds of edges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Link edges:
Created by <code>link(X,Y)</code> calls.
The edge connects the reactor X (source reactor) to Y (destiny reactor) so 
that when the source reactor terminates successfully, the destiny reactor 
is implicitly triggered.</li>
<li>Await edges:
Created by <code>await(X)</code> calls.
The edge connects X (reactor to await) to the continuation of the reactor 
being suspended.  Await edges are temporary, as the scheduler removes them 
as soon as the suspended reactor is awakened.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the parameter <code>X</code> can also be a string event.</p>

<p>In the dependency graph for introductory example the sub-nodes 1 and 2 
represent the code chunks of reactor <code>rC</code> separated by the call to <code>await</code>.</p>

<p><a name="section_spawn"/></p>

<h2>Spawning Reactors</h2>

<p>Reactors may be explicitly spawned from inside other reactors.
The <code>spawn(r)</code> primitive acts like a fork, instantaneously scheduling the 
reactor passed as parameter and the continuation of the calling reactor to run 
concurrently.</p>

<p>Follows an example, with corresponding dependency graph, illustrating the use 
of <code>spawn</code>:</p>

<p><img src="ex2.png" width="250" vspace="50" hspace="50" align="right"/></p>

<pre><code>rA = luagravity.create(
    function ()
        print 'a1' -- (A1)
        luagravity.spawn(rB)
        print 'a2' -- (A2)
        luagravity.await(rB)
        print 'a3' -- (A3)
    end)

rB = luagravity.create(
    function ()
        print 'b1'      -- (B1)
        luagravity.await(rC)
        print 'b2'      -- (B2)
    end)

rC = luagravity.create(
    function ()
        print 'c1'
    end)
</code></pre>

<p>The execution of reactor <code>rA</code> prints 'a1' and spawns the reactor <code>rB</code> (chunk 
<em>A1</em>).
The call to <code>spawn</code> immediately schedules <code>rB</code> and the continuation of <code>rA</code> 
(chunk <em>A2</em>) to execute concurrently.
The scheduler chooses non-deterministically which one to execute first.
When chunk <em>A2</em> is executed, it prints 'a2' and awaits the termination of <code>rB</code>, 
creating a temporary await edge from <code>rB</code> to the last continuation of <code>rA</code> 
(chunk <em>A3</em>).
When <code>rB</code> is spawned, it prints 'b1' and awaits <code>rC</code>, creating the temporary 
edge from <code>rC</code> to the continuation of <code>rB</code> (chunk <em>B2</em>).
The execution of <code>rC</code> awakes <code>rB</code>, which, in turn, awakes <code>rA</code>, and both 
temporary edges are destroyed.</p>

<p><a name="section_determinism"/></p>

<h2>(Non)Determinism</h2>

<p>LuaGravity is single threaded, meaning that any concurrent reactor runs 
atomically.
This way, there are no critical regions in programs and, hence, no need for a 
locking mechanism.</p>

<p>However, the execution order of concurrent reactors is non-deterministic.
In the example below it is not possible to know which spawned reactor runs 
first:</p>

<pre><code>a = 0
luagravity.spawn(function()
    a = a + 1
    print(a)   -- prints 1 or 2
end)
luagravity.spawn(function()
    a = a + 1
    print(a)   -- prints 1 or 2
end
luagravity.await(0)
print(a)       -- prints 2, for sure
</code></pre>

<!--
TODO: este exemplo eh deterministico, mas acho que tem alguns ND interessantes

In this other example, by the time `reactorA` is called, one cannot be sure if 
the spawned reactor had the chance to execute and await `reactorA`.

    luagravity.spawn(function()
        luagravity.await(reactorA)
        print 'ok!'
    end
    luagravity.call(reactorA)
-->

<p><a name="section_environment"/></p>

<h2>Environments</h2>

<p>As reactors run as consequence of changes (input events) in the environment,
LuaGravity applications must have access to such events.
Each environment, which is defined independently from LuaGravity, must document 
its available input events and also output primitives.</p>

<p>There are two supported execution models for LuaGravity applications:</p>

<p>In the <em>loop execution model</em>, LuaGravity takes control of the environment, 
requesting new events from it whenever the applications becomes idle.
The <code>luagravity.loop</code> call receives the application (main reactor) to run, and 
a function provided by the environment to requests new events.
<code>luagravity.loop</code> only returns when the application terminates.</p>

<p>The following example uses the <em>ldirectfb</em> environment, which follows the <em>loop 
execution model</em>:</p>

<pre><code>-- initialization code
local gvt = require 'luagravity'
local ldirectfb = require 'luagravity.env.ldirectfb'

-- event loop
gvt.loop(ldirectfb.nextEvent,
    function ()
        -- application code
        ...
        gvt.await('key.press.ESCAPE')
        ...
    end)
</code></pre>

<p>In the <em>step execution model</em>, the environment takes control of LuaGravity, 
issuing steps in the application whenever new events are available.
The <code>luagravity.start</code> call receives the application to run, starts it, and 
returns an opaque identifier to be used by the <code>step</code> function.
The <code>luagravity.step</code> call receives the application identifier, the event to 
trigger, and a value associated with the event.
A step returns once the full propagation chain reacting to the issued event 
terminates, what should take an infinitesimal time.</p>

<p>Follows how the <code>luagravity.loop</code> call can be implemented on top of the <em>step 
model</em>:</p>

<pre><code>function luagravity.loop (nextEvent, app)
    app = luagravity.start(app)
    while app.state ~= 'ready' do
        local evt, param = nextEvent()
        luagravity.step(app, evt, param)
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>step model</em> permits that several LuaGravity applications coexist, as it 
does not block.</p>

<p><a name="section_environment_list"/></p>

<h3>Known Environments</h3>

<p>We try to separate LuaGravity itself from the environments in which it is used.
This decoupling eases the adaptation of the language to different realms.
For instance, when programming games, the environment typically provides input 
events for key presses and collisions between sprites, and ways to draw 
graphical primitives on screen.
In a robotics environment, input comes from reading sensors, and output from 
commanding on actuators; and so on.</p>

<p>Another reason to separate the language kernel from environments is that 
LuaGravity is implemented in pure Lua, while environments usually require a C 
module to interact with the operating system and, hence, are not portable.</p>

<!--
Follow a list of supported environments (that we know) for LuaGravity:

* [Reactive Server Pages](../rsp/)

* [ldirectfb](../dfb/)

The `ldirectfb` library used in the example is a typical desktop environment 
supporting keyboard and mouse events, and also drawing graphics on screen.
An environment must be documented to expose which input events (and also output 
primitives) are available.

Other examples of Lua libraries that could be integrated with LuaGravity to 
provide additional environments are the LÖVE and Scrupp game engines, IUP and 
wxWidgets GUI systems, eLua and pbLua embedded platforms, and also LuaSocket, 
to mention some.

We do not discuss here how to *implement* environments, please check the file 
`env/ldirectfb.lua` in the distribution as an example.

<h1>The Meta Language</h1>

<p>We chose to write the LuaGravity kernel as an API supporting every possible 
mechanism in the language.
Above it, we provide a layer extending Lua with the semantics of LuaGravity.
This approach follows the usual idea in the Lua world of separating <em>mechanism</em> 
from <em>policy</em>.</p>

<p>We recommend programmers to use the <a href="meta.html"><code>meta</code> module</a> instead of the 
raw API.</p>

<p><a name="section_download"/></p>

<h1>Download &amp; Install</h1>

<p>The current version of LuaGravity is 0.6.1 and can be downloaded 
<a href="luagravity-0.6.1.tgz">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also keep a github repository <a href="http://github.com/fsantanna/luagravity">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unpack LuaGravity to somewhere in your LUA_PATH, and run the tests:</p>

<pre><code># cd /somewhere_in_lua_path
# tar xvzf luagravity-0.6.1.tgz
# mv luagravity-0.6.1/ luagravity/

# cd luagravity/tests

</code></pre>

<!--
You might also need the Lua binding to DirectFB that can be downloaded 
[here](ldirectfb-0.1.tgz):

    # tar xvzf ldirectfb-0.1.tgz
    # cd lidirectfb-0.1/
    # make
    # cp ldirectfb.so /somewhere_in_lua_path

The following examples need DirectFB:

    # cd ../examples
    # lua sky.lua
    # lua walker.lua
    # lua game.lua

<p>Creates a new reactor from a function body.</p>

<p>The reactor body must follow the signature:</p>

<pre><code>function ([obj], param) ... end
</code></pre>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>body</code>: [<code>function</code>] The actual code to be executed by the reactor.</li>
<li><code>t</code>:    [<code>table</code>]    An optional table supporting the following fields: 
<ul>
    <li><code>name</code>: [<code>string</code>] reactor's name (for debugging purposes only).
    <li><code>obj</code>:  [<code>table</code>] if set, the reactor body is always called with 
                <code>obj</code> as its first parameter.
    <li><code>inst</code>: [<code>boolean</code>] sets whether the reactor is instantaneous, that 
                is, if its body contains no <code>await</code> calls.
                In this case LuaGravity performs an important optimization,
                not creating a coroutine to run it.
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ref</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] A reference to the created reactor.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>
<em>The <code>inst</code> parameter allows an important optimization for reactors that do not 
await on their bodies. However, for reactors that do await, this parameter must 
be passed <code>false</code>.</em>
</small></p>

<p><a name="api_spawn"/>
<hr/></p>

<p><big>
    <code>reactor = luagravity.spawn (reactor, param)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Spawns the execution of the given reactor, passing a parameter.</p>

<p>The spawned reactor runs concurrently with the continuation of the running 
reactor.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>reactor</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] Reactor to execute. May also be an anonymous function 
                   that is automatically transformed into a reactor.</li>
<li><code>param</code>: [<code>any</code>] Parameter to pass to the reactor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>reactor</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] A reference to the spawned reactor.</li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p><a name="api_call"/>
<hr/></p>

<p><big>
    <code>ret = luagravity.call (reactor, param)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Executes the given reactor passing a parameter, awaiting its termination.</p>

<p>The callee reactor continues its execution only after the called reactor and 
all reactions to it terminate.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>reactor</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] Reactor to execute.</li>
<li><code>param</code>: [<code>any</code>] Parameter to pass to the reactor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ret</code>: [<code>any</code>] The return value of the called reactor.</li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p><a name="api_kill"/>
<hr/></p>

<p><big>
    <code>luagravity.kill (reactor)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Terminates the execution of the given (awaiting) reactor, cancelling it.</p>

<p>Reactors linked to (or awaiting) it are not triggered.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>reactor</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] Reactor to kill.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>nothing</em></li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p><a name="api_link"/>
<hr/></p>

<p><big>
    <code>luagravity.link (src, dst)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Creates a link between <code>src</code> and <code>dst</code>.</p>

<p>A link determines that the termination/post of the reactor/string event <code>src</code> 
triggers the reactor <code>dst</code>.
The returned value of <code>src</code> is passed to the body of <code>dst</code>.
<a href="#api_cancel">Cancelled</a> or <a href="#api_kill">killed</a> reactors do not trigger 
reactors linked to it.</p>

<p>If a source reactor links to several destiny reactors, its termination makes 
all of them to run concurrently.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>src</code>: [<code>reactor</code>|string`] Source reactor or string event.</li>
<li><code>dst</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] Destiny reactor. May also be an anonymous function that is 
               automatically transformed into an instantaneous reactor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>nothing</em></li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p><a name="api_unlink"/>
<hr/></p>

<p><big>
    <code>luagravity.unlink (src, dst)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Breaks the link between <code>src</code> and <code>dst</code>.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>src</code>: [<code>reactor</code>|<code>string</code>] Source reactor or string event.</li>
<li><code>dst</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] Destiny reactor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>nothing</em></li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<p><a name="api_await"/>
<hr/></p>

<!-- TODO: 0, -1 -->

<p><big>
    <code>ret = luagravity.await (p1, p2, ...)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Makes the running reactor await for any condition passed as parameter.
Further actions in the running reactor are not executed until it is awakened.</p>

<p>Conditions might be the termination of reactors or <a href="#api_post">posting</a> of 
string events.
A number may also be passed as parameter to make the running reactor await this 
number of milliseconds.</p>

<p>The call returns the return value of the reactor responsible for awaking the 
suspended reactor.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>...</code>: [<code>reactors</code>|<code>strings</code>|<code>numbers</code>] Conditions to await.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ret</code>: [<code>any</code>] The return value of the satisfied condition.</li>
</ul>

<hr/></p>

<p><big>
    <code>luagravity.deactivate (reactor)</code>
</big></p>

<p>Deactivates the awaiting reactor passed as parameter.</p>

<p>A deactivated reactor is not resumed when the event it is awaiting is 
triggered.
If the reactor is awaiting on Timers associated to deactivated reactors are 
paused.</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>reactor</code>: [<code>reactor</code>] The reactor to deactivate.</li>
