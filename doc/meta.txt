Introduction
============

The `meta` module extends Lua with the semantics of [LuaGravity](index.html).
With a special syntax, the programmer creates reactors instead of functions and 
reactive variables instead of conventional Lua variables.

The call to `meta.new` returns a new special table `t` in which the semantic 
extensions of LuaGravity are applied:

    local t = meta.new()
    function t.funcA () ... end
    function t._reactorA () ... end
    function t.__reactorB () ... gvt.await(...) end
    t.funcA()
    t._reactorA()   -- equivalent to gvt.call(t._reactorA)
    t.__reactorB()  -- equivalent to gvt.call(t.__reactorB)

Any function whose name is prefixed by underscores becomes a reactor.
For names starting with one underscore, instantaneous reactors are created;
for names starting with two underscores, reactors that can await are created.
Also, to call a reactor, the conventional function call syntax can be used.

It is also possible to change the global environment of a function to reflect 
the semantic extensions:

    APP = meta.apply(function ()
        function funcA () ... end
        function _reactorA () ... end
        function __reactorB () ... await(...) end
        funcA()
        _reactorA()   -- equivalent to gvt.call(_reactorA)
        __reactorB()  -- equivalent to gvt.call(__reactorB)
    end)
    gvt.loop(APP)

The function environment is also extended with all LuaGravity primitives, such 
as `await`, `link`, `spawn`, etc.

Reactive Expressions
====================

Reactive expressions are another must of reactive languages.
The value of a reactive expression is updated whenever one of its operands 
changes, always reflecting the operation first defined.

The best way to understand reactive expressions is through a simple example:

    meta.apply(function()
        _b = 1
        _c = 2
        _a = _b + _c
        print(_a())   -- prints 3
        _b = 5
        print(_a())   -- prints 7
    end)

The reactive variable `_a` depends on `_b` and `_c` so that anytime they 
change, the value of `_a` is automatically updated to reflect the sum.

As reactive variables are represented as objects, to get their actual values 
the call syntax is used, as in `_a()`.

Reactive expressions are implemented on top of the available reactivity 
primitives of LuaGravity.

Lifting
-------

When applying functions to reactive expressions, it is expected that the result 
become also reactive.
However, functions and operators in conventional languages like Lua are not 
prepared to accept reactive parameters.
It is necessary, then, to modify each of these operations to work reactively, a 
process known as *lifting*.

LuaGravity provides the `L` operator to lift functions.
In the following example, the function `assert` is lifted and is recalculated 
whenever its parameters change:

    _b = 1
    L(assert)(_b < 10, 'b must be lesser than 10')
    gvt.await(...)
    _b = 10  -- yields 'b must be lesser than 10'

<a name="section_operators"/>
Operators
---------

LuaGravity automatically lifts all operators that Lua allows to overload:

    +  -  *  /  ..  %  ^

The other operators are available as pre-defined functions in a `meta.apply` 
environment: 

<table>
<tr> <th>Lua</th>   <th>LuaGravity</th> <th>Example</th>       </tr>
<tr> <td> # </td>   <td> LEN </td>      <td> LEN(t)      </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> == </td>  <td> EQ  </td>      <td> EQ(_a, 1)   </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> < </td>   <td> LT  </td>      <td> LT(_a, 10)  </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> <= </td>  <td> LE  </td>      <td> LE(_a, _b)  </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> > </td>   <td> GT  </td>      <td> GT(a, _a)   </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> >= </td>  <td> GE  </td>      <td> GE(10, _b)  </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> not </td> <td> NOT </td>      <td> NOT(_a)     </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> or </td>  <td> OR  </td>      <td> OR(_a, _b)  </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> and </td> <td> AND </td>      <td> AND(_a, _b) </td> </tr>
</table>

<small>*(Note in the previous example that `_b<10` should actually be 
`LT(_b,10)`)*</small>

Conditionals
------------

Sometimes it is useful to take actions when a condition is satisfied.
LuaGravity provides the `cond` and `notcond` operator that can be applied to 
reactive expressions and used as conditions in `link` and `await` calls:

    link(notcond(_b), reactorA)  -- reactorA is executed when _b is false
    await( cond(GT(_a,10)) )     -- the running reactor awaits _a be greater than 10

<a name="section_calculus"/>
Integral & Derivative
---------------------

LuaGravity provides primitives for the integration and derivation (in the sense 
of calculus) of expressions over the time:

    _s = S(10)
    _d = D(s)
    await(10)
    assert(_s() >= 100 and _s() <= 101)
    assert(_d() == 10)

The following example defines the position `_p` in terms of the speed `_v`:

    _p = _p0 + S(_v)

<a name="section_cycles"/>
Causality Cycles
----------------

It is not possible to have reactive variables depending on themselves.

Suppose the position of an object depends on a speed that, in turn, depends on 
the position:

    _v   = _pos + 1
    _pos = S(_v)

This creates a dependency cycle that, when started, would run forever, freezing 
the application.

To break such cycles, LuaGravity provides a `delay` operator that can be 
applied to expressions:

    _v   = delay(_pos) + 1
    _pos = S(_v)

Another situation in which cycles can appear is when trying to build a reactive 
variable with a loop.
Suppose you have an array of reactive variables that you want to concatenate to 
create another reactive variable that changes whenever one of them changes:

    t = { _a, _b, _c, ... }
    _all = ''
    for i, _v in ipairs(t) do
        _all = _all .. _v
    end

This code makes the variable `_all` depend on itself, when the intention is to 
depend on its current dependencies.
The correct form is to use the field `_all.src`:

    t = { _a, _b, _c, ... }
    _all = ''
    for i, _v in ipairs(t) do
        _all = _all.src .. _v
    end

Object Orientation
==================

Although the colon syntax for calling methods in object orientation works fine 
with reactors, primitives like `link` and `await` are not aware of OO.
To work with objects, the `meta.new` constructor must receive `true` as its 
first parameter:

    local obj = meta.new(true)
    function obj:_reactorA (self,...) ... end
    function obj:_reactorB (self,...) ... end
    link(obj._reactorA, obj._reactorB)
    obj:_reactorB()
    obj._reactorB()

This way, whenever `_reactorB` is called it always gets `obj` as its first 
parameter, being it from a link, colon syntax, or even normal call syntax.
